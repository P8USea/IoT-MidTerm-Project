This is the script for my mid-term project for my IoT Application Development course
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The project's name is "Automatic Irrigation System".
Agriculture and landscaping rely heavily on efficient water management to ensure optimal plant growth and resource conservation. By integrating technology to manage the delivery of water, we minimize the handy work and can monitor it correctly; and yes, that saves a lot of time.
This system uses sensors to track the current condition of the soil and then make decisions about when and how much water to supply to plants.
Components to use: Esp32 DOIT Devkit V1, Soil moisture sensor, mini water pump (, and maybe humidity and temperature sensor). 
P/s: To me, it's such an interesting topic as I love planting for consuming or decorating, but were so innocent to let them dry witherly or overwater them. That makes a lot of sense if I could supervise them remotely without worrying whether they are well taken care of.
